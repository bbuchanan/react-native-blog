<h1 id="adding-native-libraries">Adding Native Libraries</h1>

<p>Undoubtedly one of the most frustrating experiences is adding 3rd party native libraries. You’re going to get all kinds of weird error messages, build issues in both Android Studio and XCode, but stick with it. I’ll offer some tips and tricks to force things to work again and provide some guidance around pitfalls.</p>

<p>The goal of the next few articles is to demonstrate basic navigation features in an app. It’s typical for a mobile app to have more than one screen and normal for a mobile app to have several top level components that the user can jump to with one press.</p>

<p>First things first, lets fix our app to remove the intentional error that forced the toast notification to pop up. Do this and verify that your app displays scores again.</p>

<h1 id="adding-react-native-vector-icons">Adding react-native-vector-icons</h1>

<p>This package is handy because it contains nicely polished icons that are typical for applications. They provide icons for both Android (material design) and iOS.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons">React Native Vector Icons</a> is the github home of this project. As usual, we’re going to use yarn add to begin adding support for this project. Unfortunately, that’s the easy part. We’ll also need to add support to both iOS and Android via the respective native project files. This will be tough the first few times you do it, but it gets easier.</p>

<p>Lets get started.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">yarn add react-native-vector-icons</code></p>

<h1 id="getting-your-native-tools-setup">Getting Your Native Tools Setup</h1>

<p>Getting this part started was outlined in the <a href="/react-native-blog/2018-03-08-react-native-environment-setup.html">React Native Environment article</a>. If you missed it, I suggest you read that before continuing here.</p>
