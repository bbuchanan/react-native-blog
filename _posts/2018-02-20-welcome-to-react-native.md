# Welcome

The purpose of this blog is to outline my first real world project done in React Native. This app will be published on the app store for both Android and iPhone. I'm going to keep client intellectual property private, but it isn't relevant to the progression of this project. This is for my benefit, largely. I've been a largely inconsistent blogger largely due to it being inconvenient. With the discovery of github pages and Visual Studio code (thank you markdown preview!), I found it a lot more convenient to fire things up and do a little writing.

## Some Background

I hadn't yet produced a React application (web or native), but have been studying it for the last 6 months. I leaned heavily on the tutorials produced by Max Schwarzm√ºller of udemy.com. Both his React 16 and Redux course and his React Native course are worth every penny. I believe they fast tracked me to success. I had not written much beyond a few screens in his tutorial before I took on the project and my client is beyond pleased with the result and it's ahead of schedule!

## A Little About Me

I've been a principal architect for a software consulting firm in Atlanta for the last 14 years. I've been developing software for over 20 years, starting with C. Then I 'graduated' to C++ and later C#. I've been developing business applications in .NET for the last 12 years with a smattering of Javascript. In the last 2 years, I've really gotten into client side development and dabbling in the various Javascript frameworks. I abanoned Angular for Vue. However, I was drawn to React because of React Native and decided to jump over into that in late 2017. And here we are today ...

## The Application Developed

The app will be a content delivery method for sports teams. The client currently has a website and a RESTful API that can serve up their exclusive content in the form of text and podcasts.

Without further delay, lets have a sneak look at the application in action.

This is the focal point of the app and getting to this point involved a lot of steps, which we'll go through. Step 1 is setting up our environment which will cover in the next post. Navigation, HTTP requests, and Redux are all a part of this and will also be detailed.
